# SteamBlacklist

literally locks users you have blocked on steam out of your lobby

also locks you out of lobbies that are hosted by blocked players

and even removes those lobbies from the lobby list

you should remove lobbycompatibility if you installed this mod when it was still a dependency, it doesn't work with this mod
